What went well:
•	Lead-in  Ss look out the window and answer questions from the Teacher.
•	Presentation : T reads “The Frog and the Princess” to the class. T rearranges desks so that all Ss can see the book / pictures etc.
•	Practise:  4” Students put words in order to make sentences on a pocket chart.
•	Ss complete worksheet. Instructions are fair.
•	Afterwards Ss share their answers whole class.
•	Production:  15” Ss write a story  using the 12 words on the worksheet, Ss must use at least 2 of them, and must have at least 2 sentences in the past tense
•	T monitors to an extent.
•	Ss read their written prose to the whole class.
•	Wrap-up  28” Ss sing “the finishing song”	Things to consider:
•	Lesson Plan:  running sheet lacks information on resources in each section of the lesson.
•	Aims and objectives seek to cover all 4 macro skills. This lesson needs to be specific in its aims – a speaking lesson. Here it is too broad.
•	Coversheet lacks info on the level of the students this lesson is aimed at.
•	Lead-in:  This lead-in does not set context, does not activate background knowledge. It is wholly unrelated to the lesson.
•	Presentation : No language is presented here at all. The Teacher needs to actually do some “teaching” here in an appropriate, Ss-centred manner. This does not necessarily involve telling (YL) Ss particular grammar points (in this case simple past) but should at least give them an idea. 
•	Reading a story is not presentation – not even inductively
•	Practise:  Resources not given to trainer. Comprehension checks are attempted, but are far to broad, “How much time do you have?” is not an effective comprehension check. Try “Is this writing or speaking?” etc.
•	The task seems too much for the Ss – at one stage even the T says “There are too many questions”.
•	What is the Target Language? Lesson plan states past simple, practice tasks involve there are/n’t, there was/n’t past form of “to be” is usually treated separately from past tense verbs +~ed etc.
•	Production:  Is the use of the term “fictive” appropriate for YLs?
•	Instructions here are poor, and lack comprehension-checking questions. In addition the instructions (and indeed the task) are too complicated – Ss have to seek clarification repetitively
•	The writing task is inappropriate here for a speaking lesson.
•	Lesson plan aims etc talk of a diary – this is not mentioned in the instructions – is this meant to be a diary writing activity. 
•	In addition how much productive writing are you going to get YLs to do in class? Much? T should not have to add information (such as explaining the term “fly in the ointment” during a production task
•	Wrap-up  Refer to lesson 4-1 and using song and chant etc in the classroom. Is it effective to just get your Ss to sing a song? Have a look at p.59 of your text book “songs and chants in the classroom”. No feedback. No error correction.
