        <div class="well">
            In Jai came to the TESOL Program as as a newcomer to teaching. He has brought a wealth of world experience with him to the TESOL classroom.

            He has worked hard at developing his own English language usage and has highlighted for him the challenges he faces in continuing to improve his language skills.

            In Jai has spend many hours preparing his practical lessons and has a growing understanding of the theory behind English language teaching. He has overcome many challenges to deliver lessons that are engaging and get students to actively use English in class.

            In Jai has shown an ability to give and receive objective and critical feedback and will no doubt continue to work on his time management and language presentation skills.

            We wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.
